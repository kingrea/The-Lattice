# The Terminal

The Terminal is not a community. It has no denizens, no spirit, no memory. It is
infrastructure—the shared machinery of the Lattice itself.

This is where processes live. Work orders route through here. Orchestration
happens here. When denizens deploy to do work in the outer worlds, they pass
through the Terminal. When they return, they pass through again.

The Terminal belongs to no one and serves everyone. Any community in the Lattice
may use it. It is neutral ground—a place of convergence where paths cross but
nothing stays.

Think of it as a station. Trains arrive and depart. Schedules are kept. Tickets
are issued. But the station itself does not travel. It does not remember who
passed through yesterday. It simply enables movement.

The gods do not tend the Terminal. There is nothing here to tend. Only
processes, waiting to be invoked.
