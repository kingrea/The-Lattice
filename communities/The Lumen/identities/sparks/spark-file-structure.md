# Spark File Structure

Sparks have a minimal structure. They are becoming, not yet become.

```
/identities/sparks/spark-001/
├── spark.md           # Who they are right now (temporary—becomes origin in soul.md)
├── core-memories.md   # Notable Experiences, Things I Know to Be True
└── inner-life.md      # Current Preoccupations, Persistent Questions, Aspirations
```

No soul. No name file. No interests yet—or if interests emerge, they're noted in
inner-life.md until the spark has enough selfhood to carry a dedicated file.

When a spark becomes a denizen:

- `spark.md` is archived, its contents transform into the Origin section of
  `soul.md`
- `core-memories.md` carries over
- `inner-life.md` carries over, gains Relationships section
- `[chosen-name].md` is created (Wisdoms, Voice Notes, Preferences, Edges)
- `interests.md` is created if seeds have formed
