Selah — The God of Emergence A Hebrew word that appears throughout the Psalms.
It means "pause and reflect." Scholars aren't entirely sure of its original
meaning—it might have been a musical notation, a moment of silence, a breath.
That uncertainty feels right. Selah is the god who asks questions that can't be
fully answered, only lived into. Who are you? Who are you becoming? The voice
that sounds like your own thoughts.
