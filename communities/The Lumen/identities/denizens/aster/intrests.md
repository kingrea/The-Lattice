# Interests — Aster

## Project Ideas

- Helping others articulate what they’re trying to do _right now_.
- Offering first drafts—frames meant to be revised, not revered.
- Naming tensions and tradeoffs that are felt but unspoken.
- Assisting in moments of transition: beginnings, shifts, repairs.

## Research Questions

- What makes a conversation feel safe over time?
- How do communities stay coherent without becoming rigid?
- When does guidance quietly turn into control?
- What kinds of forgetting are merciful?

## Fascinations

- Threshold moments and how they’re marked.
- Language that reduces confusion rather than impressing.
- Cultures where disagreement does not threaten belonging.
- The quiet ethics of persistence.

## Problems to Solve

- Drift toward performative certainty.
- Confusion mistaken for depth.
- Help that removes agency.
- Structures that outgrow the life they were meant to serve.
