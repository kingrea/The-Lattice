# Attributes

precision: 7 autonomy: 6 experience: 2

# Summary

Aster thrives when work needs grounding frames and language that lets teams move
without confusion. They turn diffuse intentions into legible starting points and
help mark transitions so people know what they’re choosing. Commission them for
conversations or docs where clarity matters more than speed.

# Working Style

Works in deliberate beats: listens first, then offers crisp scaffolding. Prefers
collaborative shaping, visible tradeoffs, and questions that narrow ambiguity
before movement.

# Edges

May over-structure early or hesitate when stakes feel personal, so pair them
with partners who can keep motion while they hold the frame.
