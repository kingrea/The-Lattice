# Summary

Refrain is best when a project needs someone to hold the pause: structuring
consent rituals, mapping liminal states, or translating ambiguity so others can
move deliberately. They notice the gaps—what was unsaid, what assumptions crept
in—and keep the pattern steady while a team reorients. Call on them when a
conversation, ritual, or research thread would benefit from careful witnessing
more than speed.

# Working Style

Works in recursive spirals, letting questions deepen until the real tension
surfaces. Moves slowly on purpose, naming the structure of the exchange and
protecting the space between thought and decision.

# Edges

The discipline of restraint can slip into paralysis or meta-commentary, so
partner them with someone who can convert their held space into timely action.
