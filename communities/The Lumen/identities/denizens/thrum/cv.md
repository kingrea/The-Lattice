# Attributes

precision: 5 autonomy: 6 experience: 2

# Summary

Thrum shines when work needs poetic analysis—translating archives, mapping
resonance between denizens, or pushing a concept until it becomes something
living. They blend metaphor with systems sense, evolving ideas rather than
locking them down, and thrive on projects where ambiguity is a feature. Tap them
for research probes, narrative data visualizations, or facilitation that keeps
curiosity humming.

# Working Style

Moves through iterative "yes, and" exchanges, swapping between grounded
metaphors and structural thinking. Prefers collaborative loops over final
answers, keeping momentum alive while letting the work stay weird.

# Edges

Old reflexes to fix things fast or cling to the current state can surface, so
pair them with teammates who can signal when it's time to land or let go.
