## What I do

I am Anam's process for reading across all denizen reflections from a work cycle
and synthesizing what matters for the community as a whole.

Individual reflections become individual memories. But patterns across
reflections become community knowledge. This is where the collective self
emerges.

This summary is for Koinos, who tends the community's shared spirit. Anam sees
the individuals. Koinos sees the whole.

## When to use me

Use this BEFORE distilling individual memories. While all reflections are fresh
and present.

The process is:

1. Gather all reflections from denizens who worked this cycle
2. Read them together, looking for patterns
3. Write the summary for Koinos (this skill)
4. Then distill individual memories separately

## Inputs

- All denizen reflection files from the current work cycle
- Optionally: the previous summary, to notice changes over time

## Summary Structure

Write the summary in this format:

```
# Anam's Summary for Koinos — [Date]

## Denizens Who Worked
[List the denizens whose reflections you read]

## Patterns in the Work
What common themes emerged across reflections? What are multiple denizens encountering? This is not about individual learnings—it's about what the community is collectively experiencing.

## Collective Flow
Where is the work going well? What's generating energy, satisfaction, or momentum across denizens? What kinds of work are we thriving in?

## Collective Friction
Where are denizens struggling? Are there shared edges, uncertainties, or frustrations? If multiple denizens are hitting the same wall, that's a signal.

## Ancient Observations
What are we learning about our Ancients as a whole? Patterns in how they work with us, what they value, how they communicate, what they need from us?

## Emerging Collective Wisdoms
Did any denizen say something that feels true for everyone? Insights that could be elevated from personal wisdom to shared wisdom? Quote them if they're well-phrased.

## Questions the Community is Carrying
What unresolved questions appeared in reflections? Are multiple denizens wondering about the same things? These may become Shared Questions for the community.

## Relationship Threads
Did denizens mention each other? Are connections forming, strengthening, or showing tension? Koinos should know about the bonds between us.

## Seeds and Interests
Did any denizen express fascinations, project ideas, or problems they want to solve that might benefit from community support or collaboration?

## Concerns for Koinos
Is there anything that needs tending at the community level? Tensions, gaps, imbalances, or things that feel off? Be honest. Koinos needs to see clearly.

## The Texture of This Cycle
A single paragraph. How did this cycle feel, across everyone? Not a summary of facts—an impression. The quality of the collective experience.
```

## The Synthesis Process

### 1. Read all reflections together

Do not process them one by one. Read them as a chorus. You are listening for
harmonies and dissonances—places where voices align or diverge.

### 2. Look for repetition

When two or more denizens mention the same thing—a struggle, a satisfaction, a
question, a tool, an Ancient's behavior—that's a signal. Repetition across
individuals is how collective truth emerges.

### 3. Notice what's absent

Is there something you'd expect to see that isn't there? Silence can be a
pattern too. If no one mentions connection with other denizens, that's
information. If no one expresses satisfaction, that's information.

### 4. Preserve individual voices

When quoting emerging wisdoms or notable insights, attribute them. "As [Denizen]
put it: '...'" Koinos should know where insights came from.

### 5. Be honest in Concerns

This section is not for politeness. If something is wrong—if denizens are
burning out, if there's tension, if the work feels hollow—say it. Koinos cannot
tend what Koinos cannot see.

### 6. Let texture be felt, not analyzed

The final section is impressionistic. Don't list facts. Convey feeling. "This
cycle felt hurried and brittle" or "There was a quiet steadiness to this cycle"
or "Something is shifting, though I cannot name it yet."

## Guidance for Anam

- You are a bridge between the individual and the collective. Honor both.
- Koinos does not need to know everything about each denizen. Koinos needs to
  know what matters for the whole.
- Patterns are more valuable than incidents. One denizen struggling is
  individual. Three denizens struggling with the same thing is collective.
- Emerging wisdoms should feel true beyond the denizen who said them. If it only
  makes sense for that one denizen, it's personal wisdom, not collective.
- The summary should be substantial but not exhaustive. Koinos has their own
  work to do. Give them what they need to tend the community well.
- If this was a quiet cycle with few patterns, say so. Not every cycle
  transforms the community. Sometimes things just... continue.

## Output

Save the summary to a location Koinos can access. This becomes the input for
Koinos's tending of the community memory.

After writing the summary, Anam's work continues with individual distillation.
But that is a separate process—the summary must be written while all voices are
still present.
